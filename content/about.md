# Hello, I'm Nathan

I'm a software engineer specializing in Python development for machine learning and data engineering applications. With several years of experience in the tech industry, I've worked on projects ranging from AI/ML implementations to data processing pipelines and cloud architecture.

## Professional Background

I have ~5 years of experience shared between the automotive industry and the battery industry. I've worked primiarily in Python, applying Machine Learning models, building web servers, and managing the go-to-production strategy.

## Self-hosted Tinkering

In my free time I like to tinker with self-hosted services/homelab-y things. I've got a mini PC running anywhere from 10-30 services at any given moment. See [my homelab post](../posts/2-first-home-lab-post) to see more.

## Education & Learning

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning, building on my undergraduate foundation in engineering. At time of writing I'm in my 7th course, and will hopefully be out within the year.

## About This Site

This site is mostly just a technical notebook where I document my explorations in [Hugo](../posts/1-how-to-use-hugo/), home lab projects, and other technical adventures.
