# Hello, I'm Nathan

I'm a software engineer specializing in Python development for machine learning and data engineering applications. With several years of experience in the tech industry, I've worked on projects ranging from AI/ML implementations to data processing pipelines and cloud architecture.

## What I Do

I build scalable data systems, optimize machine learning workflows, and develop tools that make data more accessible and useful. My experience spans:

- Designing cloud-based data architectures
- Implementing ML models for practical applications
- Performance optimization for data processing pipelines
- Leading technical teams and fostering collaboration
- Establishing robust engineering practices

## Professional Background

My work experience centers around Python ecosystems for data science and engineering. I work extensively with:

- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
- Containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Data processing frameworks (Pandas, Spark)
- Machine learning tools and libraries
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines

## Home Lab/Self-hosted Enthusiast

Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about self-hosting and running my own home lab. I've set up and maintain several services that are always changing. It's amazing when it works, and frustrating when it doesn't!

I enjoy taking control of my digital life through open-source solutions and local-first technology. You can read more about my setup in my [homelab post](../posts/2-first-home-lab-post/).

## Education & Learning

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning, building on my undergraduate foundation in engineering. I believe in continuous learning and regularly explore new technologies and techniques.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy video games, running, and playing with my cats. I also spend time tinkering with my home lab, automating parts of my home, and exploring new self-hosted applications. I'm passionate about solving complex problems with elegant solutions and helping teams deliver high-quality software that makes an impact.

## About This Site

This site serves as both my professional portfolio and a technical notebook where I document my explorations in [Hugo](../posts/1-how-to-use-hugo/), home lab projects, and other technical adventures.
